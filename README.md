# nrf5_sdk
Software development kit for the nRF52 Series and nRF51 Series SoCs

Simplify updating Nordic SDK versions by using a vendor branch. Fork this repo, create your app, and then pull in updates when Nordic releases a new SDK version. Clean extracts of the SDK are on the branch "vendor". The only modification is linux line-endings and removing the .msi binaries.
